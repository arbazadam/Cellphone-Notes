In python there is no char data type unlike java C and C++. A string is composed of several characters,Hence when we think of a character we should think of it as an element in a string.

In python we cannot define constants. we can just have a variable with all uppercase letters but its value can be modified.

In python a module is a file that contains a group of useful objects like functions,classes or variable. Eg math is a module to perform various mathematical operations.

â€¢Following ways to import modules in python.

> import math

We can then do this. x= math.sqrt(16)

> import math as m

We can then do this. x= m.sqrt(16)

> from math import sqrt

We can then do this. x=sqrt(16)

> from math import *

We can then do this. x= sqrt(16)
y=factorial(6)
z=floor(9)
