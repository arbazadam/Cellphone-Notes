• Never call document.write after the document has finished loading. It will overwrite the whole document.

 • Always place your javascript code below ur body tag. Otherwise it will give error.

Accessing a function without parenthesis(i.e () ) will return the function definition instead of the function result.

8. Why can’t browsers read JSX?
Browsers can only read JavaScript objects but JSX in not a regular JavaScript object. Thus to enable a browser to read JSX, first, we need to transform JSX file into a JavaScript object using JSX transformers like Babel and then pass it to the browser.

In strict mode undeclared variables are not automatically global.

I just found out myself.  JS is the core language.  NodeJS allows JS programs to run outside a browser--sort of like a spacesuit/space station that allows people to work outside of earth.  VueJS and ReactJS are competing improvements to JS language.

npm is node package manager, whereas npx executes the available package on the classpath
