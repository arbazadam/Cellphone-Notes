Data types in sqlite dbms

INTEGER :- any integer type
TEXT:- any character type
REAL:- any floating-point number
BLOB:- Binary Large Object

whenever we want to make use of the sqlite database. We need to extend the SQLiteOpenHelper class. There are two abstract methods of this class onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) and onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db,int oldversion,int newVersion).

to execute the create query. we use db.execSQL(String sql)

to execute the insert query. We first construct the ContentValues object. Then bind all the values to the appropriate columns by doing this.

contentValues.put("column_name",value). Then we use db.insert("table_name",null,content_values_object);.

The middle parameter is usually set to null. Its there in case the content values object is empty, and you want to insert an empty row into your table. its unlikely you'd want to do this. but if u did you'd replace the null value with the name of the columns in your table.
